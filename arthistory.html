  <p>Art Nouveau is an international style of art, architecture, and applied art, especially the decorative arts. The style was most popular between 1890 and 1910 during the Belle Époque period that ended with the start of World War I in 1914. It was a reaction against the academic art, eclecticism and historicism of 19th century architecture and decoration. It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers. Other characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement, often given by asymmetry or whiplash lines, and the use of modern materials, particularly iron, glass, ceramics, and later concrete, to create unusual forms and larger open spaces.</p>
  <p>One major objective of Art Nouveau was to break down the traditional distinction between fine arts and applied arts. It was most widely used in interior design, graphic arts, furniture, glass art, textiles, ceramics, jewelry, and metal work. In Britain, it was influenced by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. German architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting total work of art that would unify the architecture, furnishings, and art in the interior in a common style, to uplift and inspire the residents.</p>
  <p>It reached its peak at the 1900 Paris International Exposition, which introduced the Art Nouveau work of artists such as Louis Tiffany. It appeared in graphic arts in the posters of Alphonse Mucha, and the glassware of René Lalique and Émile Gallé.</p>
  <p>From Belgium and France, it spread to the rest of Europe, taking on different names and characteristics in each country. It often appeared not only in capitals, but also in rapidly growing cities that wanted to establish artistic identities, as well as in centers of independence movements.</P>
