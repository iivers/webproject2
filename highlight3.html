  <h1>Monaco Monte Carlo</h1>
</div>
<div class= "bodytext">
  <p>The style of the Monaco Monte Carlo piece focuses on a beautiful woman, relaxing on the Mediterranean coast. Appearing to be in a relaxed and meditative state, the female figure clasps her hands to her face, looking skywards as if she is transfixed by something in the sky. The long parallel stems (a metaphor for the train tracks) of the buddleia and the use of a circular halo containing flowers, birds and leaves suggest the heavenly quality of this place. Red flowers tied into her hair, her striking black hair and eyes and her strapless dress represent the use of attractive models to promote brands: another theme of Muchaâ€™s advertising posters.</p>
